# mas-password-generator

Client request was to create a mini application that will generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters. Users must have a choice to include different elements in their password including lowercase letters, upercase letters, numbers and special characters. Once these choices are made the final password must output onto the screen.

## Lessons Learned

THis project was chalanging. I wavered between lows of not knowing what to do next to highs of Eureka! I fanally figured it out! This is the first time I've ever gotten a JS to actually do something practical and interact with and HTML document.
